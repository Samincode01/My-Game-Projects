# ðŸŽ® Stridefall: Solo Adventure

**Stridefall: Solo Adventure** is a simple 2D platformer game built in Unity as my first full game project. I created it over a few days to practice C# scripting and get hands-on experience with game development.

This project is beginner-friendly, open-source, and made with love and persistence. While it's simple, itâ€™s a fun little experience â€” and a proud milestone for me.
